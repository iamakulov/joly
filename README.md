# Joly
### Connect your web and your computer in the one place.
Joly is an amazing application that connects your online accounts and offline resources and lets you use them all from one place, simply. The app is all about clear and unified experience of the combination of the Web and the Desktop.

Joly is built using C++ and Qt; it is ported to Windows and Linux.

We use [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net) to maintain the application; bugs, ideas, questions and translations should be submitted on the [project's page](https://launchpad.net/jolyapp).
